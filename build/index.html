HMB has since migrated all over the globe with teams from over 41 countries, 4 200 HMB athletes aged over 18 years worldwide. There are annual world championship tournaments that see the best fighters from all over the world compete in both duelling and group categories.</p><div><div><h3>1v1 Duels</h3><img src="" alt=""><p>Duels are points based 1-on-1 fights. The goal is to win as many points as you can within the given time. Based on the traditional skills of swordsmanship, HMB duelling range includes Sword and Shield, Sword and Buckler, Longsword, Polearm, and Profight categories.</p></div><div><h3>Group Fights</h3><img src="" alt=""><p>This is a team discipline, sometimes called Buhurt (from Old French béhourd: "wallop"). The main objective is to be the last team on your feet. You can use swords, axes, maces, halberds – you name it, and your goal is to ground your opponents, either by a powerful blow, by using a grappling technique, or by throwing them.</p></div></div><p>You can choose your discipline to focus on. Perhaps you want to be a sword and shield duels fighter? Alternatively, you might prefer to stand shoulder to shoulder with your teammates, smashing down the enemy lines with a poleaxe?</p><p>At the Felag Club we can teach you duels and buhurt HMB. All you need to do is to start. We have all you need to succeed – a dedicated training venue and equipment, flexible training system, and knowledgeable coaches to help you on your journey.</p></section><section><h2>Our Training</h2><p>Our club conducts regular, structured training.
